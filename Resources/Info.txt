*REPLACE WITH REAL TEXT PRIOR TO RELEASE*

Color Faker replaces the Generic RGB and sRGB color profiles with the main display's profile.

As a side-effect, any "Convert to sRGB" or "Assign sRGB Profile" commands in applications will no longer work.  You will still be able to manually assign the backup sRGB profile.
